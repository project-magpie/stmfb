This directory contains a set of classes abstracting the functionality of a 
display architecture containing a real-time hardware video mixer and hardware
graphics, cursor and video display planes attached to it. Somewhere in the
mists of time the basic kit of components for this display type was generically
called "Gamma". Some of these files are the oldest remaining in the driver,
from before it was owned by the STLinux development team, which is why some
of the file names and class names are a bit baroque.
