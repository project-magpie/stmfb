* stmfb-3.1_stm23_0021
- WARNING: The HDMI InfoFrame mechanism has been completely rewritten so that
  new hardware can be accomodated and so that the current hardware can be 
  programmed using a DMA engine instead of the CPU. Do not be suprised to find
  bugs despite our best efforts; if you do not want to experiment stay with
  stmfb-3.0_stm23_0020.
- CHANGE: The HDMI device interface for sending various InfoFrames and other
  data island packets has changed. ISRC packets and a usable mechanism for
  queuing multiple Vendor specific InfoFrames is now available.
- NEW: The IOCTL STMHDMIIO_SET_HOTPLUG_MODE has been added to the HDMI device,
  allowing one of 3 different behaviours when a hotplug de-assert is detected.
  See Linux/stm/coredisplay/stmhdmi.h for details.
- NEW: The IOCTL STMHDMIIO_SET_CEA_MODE_SELECTION has been added to the HDMI
  device. This allows the method, by which the CEA mode number in the AVI
  InfoFrame for modes that support 4:3 and 16:9 variants, is selected. See
  Linux/stm/coredisplay/stmhdmi.h for details.

* stmfb-3.0_stm23_0017
- NEW: Support for STx7105.
- NEW: Support for STi5202/MB602.
- NEW: Support for HDMI IT content information in the AVI InfoFrame via a new
  HDMI device IOCTL STMHDMIIO_SET_CONTENT_TYPE.
- NEW: Added output API function stm_display_output_soft_reset() which when
  called on master outputs will reset the timing generator causing a top
  field vsync to be issued immediately. To be used to do a coarse adjustment
  of the output vsync relative to the input vsync of captured video.
- NEW: HDMI safe mode when EDID is unreadable, as documented in CEA-861-E
  section F.3.5. The safe mode reports the sink as DVI supporting 640x480p.
- NEW: Added new HDMI device IOCTL STMHDMIIO_SET_EDID_MODE_HANDLING; this 
  changes the behaviour of the HDMI management thread, allowing HDMI to 
  transmit display modes not listed in the connected sink's EDID. The
  hdmi-control utility has the related new option --edid-mode .
- NEW: Added output API function stm_display_output_set_filter_coefficients()
  which can be used to change the DENC luma and chroma filters (previous 
  control based mechanism has been removed) and the component analogue DAC
  sample rate converter filters on 7111/7105/7141 and 7200cut2.
- CHANGE: Updated HDMI EDID parsing and reporting in sysfs for CEA-861-E.
- CHANGE: Do not set the HDMI AVI InfoFrame RGB quantization bits unless
  the corresponding QS bit in the TV's EDID VCDB block has been set and we
  are outputting RGB.
- CHANGE: HDMI AVI InfoFrame under/over scan information now supports setting
  the "not known" value, a new HDMI device IOCTL STMHDMIIO_SET_OVERSCAN_MODE and
  argument type stmhdmiio_overscan_mode_t has been added; the previous IOCTL
  STMHDMIIO_SET_VIDEO_SCAN_TYPE has been removed.
- CHANGE: support 1080p50/60 on analogue out where hardware is capable
- [Bugzilla: 4347] Fix 7200cut2 HDMI/SPDIF configuration error.
- [Bugzilla: 4435] Fix HDMI AVI InfoFrame colorimetry bits when outputting RGB.

* stmfb-3.0_stm23_0016
- NEW: Add support for HDMI ACP packets
- NEW: Added /sys/class/stmcoredisplay/info attribute which reports useful
  information about the driver build. Use this to determine if you are running
  the driver version you think you are running before reporting bugs.
- NEW: Support soruce video crop coordinates in 1/32nd of a pixel as well as
  1/16th and whole pixels.
- NEW: Support for STx7141, it has exactly the same feature set as STi7111.
- CHANGE: 1080i de-interlacing using full conf motion mode with 8bit motion
  buffers provoked memory bandwidth artifacts. This change selects the reduced
  4bit motion mode for content width >960 pixels and appears to eliminate
  the artifacts.
- CHANGE: allow HW de-interlacing for all allowable downscales when displaying
  on an interlaced display. This allows better quality 1080i->PAL/NTSC
  conversion. When doing SD->1/4SD scaling, for example as part of an EPG,
  de-interlacing can always be explicitly turned off using the plane controls
  if required.
- CHANGE: the fixed point maths that calculates the HW sample rate converter
  steps when doing a stretch blit has been changed to round the result instead
  of doing a "floor". This minimises the absolute pixel position error that can
  be introduced by the 10bit fixed point maths used by the HW.
- CHANGE: on the 7200cut2, de-interlacer motion buffers (approximately 3Mb) are
  now allocated from the bigphysarea partition instead of the coredisplay-video
  partition. This is to balance memory bandwidth usage while processing 1080i
  video.
- [Bugzilla: 3740] fix subpixel position register programming in BDisp nodes 
  when generating a stretchblit operation that requires multiple spans.
- [Bugzilla: 4330] set the current output format when starting the auxillary
  display pipeline. This now correctly configures YPrPb/RGB output via the
  HD DACs on all SoCs that support "SCART mode" on the auxillary display.

* stmfb-3.0_stm23_0015
- NEW: Add preliminary support for 7200cut2.
- NEW: Add support for HDMI YUV 422 output.
- NEW: Add DVO output format configuration support to STMFBIO_SET_OUTPUT_CONFIG
  ioctl and stfbset.
- NEW: Hardware progressive to interlaced conversion enabled on 7111 and
  7200cut2 main video pipelines, allowing the full range of the vertical 
  rescaler to be used in all circumstances.
- NEW: De-interlacing of 1080i content enabled on 7111 and 7200cut2.
- NEW: IQI supported on 7111

       on 7111 and 7200Cut2.
- NEW: add DEI plane controls
- NEW: yuvplayer test program to play back raw yuv (video) streams.
- [Bugzilla: 3908] Issues with 59/60Hz only sinks and fast mode changes. It
  has been necessary to disable fast mode changes between 50Hz and 59.94/60Hz
  modes to avoid problems with HDMI on US TV's that do not support 50Hz.
- [Bugzilla: 4004] Support new config name for HMS1 board in -0111 kernel.
- [Bugzilla: 4005] Fix simultaneous SD SCART and HD HDMI output on 7111.
- [Bugzilla: 4006] Rework VTG setup for the DENC in 7200 and 7111.

  There seems to be an issue in the HDMI cell, making the serializer fail
  sometimes. A work-around has been found by experimentation which has
  been successfully tested on 7100c3.3, 7109c3.0 & 7109c3.2
- [Bugzilla: 4107] Fix the video filter coefficient loading logic such that
  multiple instances of the class do not interfere with each other.
- [Bugzilla: 4165] same as 3906 but for STi7200.
- [Bugzilla: 4224] cope with 64MB banks in blitter

====================
stmfb-3.0_stm23_0014
====================

New Features
------------
1. Add preliminary HD FlexDVO support to STi7200 (note external H/V sync
   only, no embedded EAV/SAV supported at this point).

Changes/Fixes
-------------
1. Bug#3724. Fix kernel fault when loading the framebuffer module before the
   coredriver module.
2. Bug#3742. Fix stfbset mis-setting DVO configuration.
3. Changes to 7200 and 7111 HDMI PHY setup, improving behaviour in SD/ED modes
   on some TVs.
4. Bug#3786. Change the HDMI maximum extended control period delay for
   1080p@24/25/30Hz display modes to 1 vsync, hence <50ms.
5. Bug#3876. Surface fromat query broken on 7200 FlexVP video plane.

====================
stmfb-3.0_stm23_0013
====================

New Features
------------

1. Preliminary STi7111 support.
2. Support TNR through xVP70.
3. Add Linux support for changing the video clipping range independently on
   analogue and digital outputs, for display setup using Pluge patterns. This 
   is part of the output config IOCTL, stfbset has been extended to report and
   change these values.
4. Added new output interface stm_display_output_setup_clock_reference() that
   allows board support code to specify the input crystal frequency (27 or
   30Mhz) and an error value in ppm for the clock reference.
5. Added new output control STM_CTRL_CLOCK_ADJUSTMENT which allows the display
   clock frequency to be adjusted upto +-500ppm for use in digital clock
   recovery or "software" genlocking to a DVP captured video source.

Changes/Fixes
-------------
1. Bug#3347. Fix 7200 GDP breakup in 1080i@60Hz when the CPU is saturating the
   bus.
2. API change: the node's pCompletedCallback() signature was changed to
   include CRC values (only valid for main display pipeline and with DEI
   turned off).
3. Bug#3395. Fix HDMI sync output polarity for negative sync modes. This
   improves 480p and 480i on some TVs that were not tolerant to the reversed
   syncs.
4. Bug#3491. Fix upscaling some small video image sizes to 1080i caused diagonal
   striped images.
5. Horizontal and vertical video resize filters updated to latest reference
   tables for VDP/DEI based video planes (7109 main, all 7200 and 7111 video
   planes). This includes separate filter tables for chroma sampling, better
   chroma upsampling when luma is not being resampled and corrected
   interpolation when doing subpixel pan and scan but no luma resampling.
6. Bug#3508. Fix incorrect HDMI VSync lengths in NTSC & PAL.
7. Removed support for 483p display modes. This was a leftover to allow 
   DirectFB to change between 480i and 480p, but this is no longer required as
   DirectFB layer configuration has been extended by ST to distinguish between
   interlaced and progressive display modes.
8. Bug#3523. Fix EDID parsing for CEA extended block tags.
9. CHANGED: The default framebuffer graphics plane behaviour is now NOT to 
   rescale graphics to video range. See the stmfb documentation for 
   futher details on this.
10.Bug#3574. Fix HDMI I2C probing corrupts Quantum Data 882 EDID contents.
11.Restore 7109Cut2 support for Tribbox.
12.Cope with I2C bus number change in current 2.6.23 kernels for MB411.
13.Undo the change to setting HDMI overscan/underscan in 0012, it is a property
   of the content not the TV.
15.Removed stfbcontrol from the source tree.
16.Change the default mixer background colour so all components are in the sRGB
   video range, i.e. no component < 16.
17.Fix the reporting of TVs with no name in hdmi-info, it mistakenly reported
   that no information about the TV could be discovered as if it wasn't
   responding to I2C.

====================
stmfb-3.0_stm23_0012
====================

New Features
------------
1. Fully interpret the HDMI 1.3 vendor specific data block; attributes
   have been added to the hdmi sysfs class to report these to userspace. Note
   that this includes the CEC address assigned to us by the downstream device.

Changes/Fixes
-------------
1. Bug#3075. The bottom few lines on video planes can be corrupted in HD modes
2. Added memory transaction config support for DEI/VDP based video planes, this
   for example removes video artifacts when downscaling HD video to SD.
3. Workaround for unreliable video resize filter coefficient loading in 7200
   VDP.
4. Improved analogue video signal generation for ED/HD modes on 7200. This
   requires a new set of AWG firmwares.
5. Fixed horizontal video rescaling by 1/4 on 7109 DEI and all 7200 video planes
6. Bug#3220. Wrong I2C bus used on CB101. 
7. Added support for using additional memory (from LMI_VID). This requires an
   updated options line to stmfb.ko and an updated DirectFB package as well.
8. TIME HAS CHANGED!!!! The driver now expects presentation timestamps relative
   to the POSIX monotonic clock, not the wall clock (gettimeofday). Kernel users
   needs to use ktime_get/ktime_to_us and V4L2 users need to use clock_gettime
   to get the value of CLOCK_MONOTONIC (the test v4l2stream has been updated to
   show how to do this). This avoids video presentation glitches when the wall
   clock is adjusted, for instance by a network time daemon.
9. Don't allow HDMI underscan to be set if the connected TV does not specify
   support for this in the CEA extension format flags.
10.Added some required glue setup for HDMI audio on 7200 so the kernel ALSA
   drivers do not need to touch any display registers.

====================
stmfb-3.0_stm23_0011
====================

New Features
------------
1. Cursor plane support in the core driver.
   (o) It just acts like any other plane, but with size and format limitations
   (o) Animations can be done by queuing buffers just like graphics or video
   (o) New plane flags and controls support a global XY screen position
       for the cursor plane, so many immediate changes to the mouse cursor
       position can be made without lag.
2. New output control STM_CTRL_SIGNAL_RANGE allows control of digital video
   signal clipping before the output stage. The default for all outputs is now
   STM_SIGNAL_FILTER_SAV_EAV, which removes 0 and 255. Signals can be clipped
   to 16-235/240 by setting the control value STM_SIGNAL_VIDEO_RANGE. Note there
   is no Linux userspace interface to this at the moment.
3. New application "stfbset" which replaces "stfbcontrol":
     o supports selecting which framebuffer device to control
     o can show the current configuration
     o can change the mixer background colour
     o uses standard unix command line option format
4. The DENC luma and chroma filter setup can now be configured in the 
   Linux core driver board support files. See the comments in the 7100 and 7109
   board files for Luma filter examples.

Changes/Fixes
-------------
1. Bug#2880. Correct display of 1080p images in 422R and planar YUV formats on
   the 7109 and 7200 main video pipelines.
2. Bug#2933. Correct error path cleanup when core driver initialization fails.
3. Bug#3023. Fix obvious horizontal rescale artifacts at span boundaries on
   7109/7200 BDisp implementation.
4. Fix a problem with blended blits if the copy direction was reversed (i.e. 
   bottom/right -> top/left).
5. Bug#3049. Fix kernel crash when FBIO_WAITFORVSYNC ioctl is called.

====================
stmfb-3.0_stm23_0010
====================

Changes/Fixes
-------------
1. Remove 7109C2 module support in Linux.
2. Fix 2.6.23 builds on MB411,MB442 and MB448 platforms, a late change to
   kernel config defines was missed.
3. Removed debugfs register entries on 710x, this mechanism will not work in
   32bit (SE) mode.
4. Support HDMI AV Mute set/clear in hdmi-control test.
5. Updated coredisplay documentation, yes we do support STi7200

====================
stmfb-3.0_stm23_0009
====================

New Features
------------
1. Add a character device for HDMI. Reading the device returns the full raw
   edid (all 255 possible blocks) if a TV is connected. An IOCTL interface is
   also defined in Linux/include/stmhdmi.h (also available in the target 
   filesystem as part of the kernel headers package).
2. Port to 2.6.23 kernel (supports 29bit and 32bit SH4 configurations).

Changes/Fixes
-------------
1. Better reporting of HDMI CEA short codes, including marking of native modes
   with an asterix
2. Preliminary code for reading all extended HDMI EDID blocks.
3. Class device and sysfs usage has changed, there is now a "stmcoredisplay"
   class entry in sysfs containing entries displayN for each display pipeline.
   HDMI entries now exist underneath the display pipeline the HDMI output
   belongs to.
4. The hdmi-info application has been changed to match the new class device
   structure in sysfs. Added support for reporting the device name and to
   select the device to query.
5. Removed the blitter IOCTL interface in the V4L2 module. This was never
   intended for general use so is being removed for the LDDE2.3 release.

====================
stmfb-3.0_stm23_0008
====================

New Features
------------
1. Support for PAL-60 output on CVBS.
2. New Linux framebuffer IOCTLs to get/set the output configuration: controling
   analogue output enables, SD TV standard, hdmi enable and properties, mixer
   background colour and DENC picture controls (brightness,contrast etc..). 
   Previous individual IOCTLs for these have been removed.
3. Analogue DACs and HDMI can now be individually enabled and disabled. When
   HDMI is disabled, the HDMI management thread still recognises hotplug events
   and makes the EDID information available in sysfs, even though the display
   link is not switched on.

Changes/Fixes
-------------
1. Fix BCH clock in HD modes on 7200 HDMI output. Info frames and YUV output
   now appear to work.
2. Some changes to the blitter implementations to help support DirectFB
   colour modulation flags in a wider set of circumstances. Ideally this
   needs to be matched with an updated DirectFB package, to be made available
   soon. 
3. Bug#2186. Fix NTSC-443 colour.
4. Removed completely STi5528 and STm8000 code from the tree.
5. Bug#2379. Fix bdisp initialzation.
6. Fix a HDMI management state issue which prevented HDMI restarting immediately
   if the framebuffer module was loaded and then immediately reloaded again.
7. Speed up driver loading of display firmwares (requires firmware
   package v1.8+1.3).

====================
stmfb-3.0_stm23_0007
====================

New Features
------------
1. A brand new package name (spot the difference?) now we really can't be
   confused with STAPI. Note this is now a LDDE2.3 only package.
2. A new version number, because the V4L2 driver has changed name and the
   coredriver API is not compatible and will break users of
   WrenDVD/LinuxDVB(Player1); see (4) and (6) in changes/fixes.
3. Preliminary 7200/MB519 support.
    + All three display pipelines available.
    + All planes available, graphics and video.
    + The same blitter functionality as 7109, DirectFB supported.
    + Analogue and HDMI outputs.
    - HDMI YUV output fails in HD modes (possibly corrupted info frames), use
      RGB instead for the moment.
4. Preliminary internal support for blit composited "virtual" planes, displayed
   on a GDP.

Changes/Fixes
-------------
1. Core driver now supports internal memory allocation from a Linux bpa2 
   partition named "coredisplay-video" for LMI VID on 710x.
2. The 7109DEI now switches which de-interlacing mode it uses depending on
   if it could allocate motion buffer memory from the correct place (e.g. LMI
   VID). If it can it will use full motion de-interlacing, if not than it
   uses the median filtering mode that has been the default in previous
   releases. This requires a 1MB "coredisplay-video" bpa2 partition to be
   configured in the kernel board setup.
3. The 7100DEI now allows hardware de-interlacing on buffers up to
   960pixels wide as supported by the hardware. Previously it was limited to
   736 pixels.
4. The V4L2 output driver provided in this package has been rewritten to
   create devices based on the display pipeline information available from
   the core driver module's platform device data. This has changed the device
   mapping, and changes the way planes on the secondary displays are handled.
   The created devices can be enumerated by looking at the entries in
   /sys/class/video4linux once the module has loaded. Note the driver has now
   changed to a generic name, without a chip postfix, as the implementation is
   no longer chip specific.
5. The V4L2 output driver now allocates buffer memory from a bpa2 partition
   called "v4l2-video-buffers", for planes on the 710x that need to use LMI VID.
   If bpa2 is not configured in the kernel or no such partition is configured
   in the kernel board setup then it will not be possible to request buffers
   for these planes. The build options CONFIG_STG_LMI_VID_BASE and
   CONFIG_STG_LMI_VID_SIZE have been removed.
6. The core driver buffer queuing interface has been changed such that it now
   requires a physical hardware address for the buffer data, not a virtual
   address. This impacts all drivers using the core driver, but on the bright
   side will mean the driver is completely clean in its usage of Linux address
   spaces and might actually work when 32bit SH4 Linux becomes available.
7. Fix rangechecking bug in stmcore_get_display_pipeline.
8. Fix a bug in the C interface device lock handling, resulting in the interface
   not being thread safe if a device handle had more than one user.
9. Bug#1129. Move HDMI hotplug PIO configuration and polling into the Linux core
   driver and the platform specific setup.
10.Bug#1278. Incorrect CLUT used on console when display driver first loaded
11.Bug#1897. Fix CLUT support on GDPs and missing framebuffer release lock on
   set videomode error path.
12. Bug#1965. Flicker filter capability not reported before a display mode is
   is set, which prevents the Linux framebuffer code from using the FF.
13. Bug#2022. STMFBIO_SET_HDMI_VIDEO fails when no TV is connected.

====================
stgfb-2.0_stm22_0006
====================

New Features
------------
1. Bug#1574. Added provisional support for PAL-Nc and NTSC-443 SD encodings,
   including adding linux framebuffer module parameter support to select these
   as the default SD encoding.
2. Support for HMS1 board, as in -39 kernel. Note only for 7100 and 7109Cut3.
3. Add the ability to rescale colour values from full range (0-255) to 
   the normal TV video output range (16-235) on GDPs. The framebuffer now has
   this switched _on_ by default to prevent graphics images from clipping when
   output. The behaviour can be changed via the framebuffer extended var IOCTL,
   and stfbcontrol.

Changes/Fixes
-------------
1. Bug#1472. Disable flicker filter on 8bit framebuffers.
2. Accelerated DirectFB stretch blit is now supported on source images >128
   pixels wide on 7109.
3. Bug#1571. Changed analogue vsync line generation for 480p and 576p, the
   negative pulse ended too close to the end of the line.
4. Bug#1573. Changed the sync generation for 295M (1920x1080i @50Hz 1250 total
   lines) to match the ST reference driver settings.
5. Changed analogue generation of VGA so that a signal is only
   produced when RGB output is selected and so that there are no embedded
   syncs. Therefore a D-Sub connector is required with H&V sync connected to
   the external sync outputs of the chip.
6. Bug#1576. Reinstate PAL-M as an available standard for 480i
7  Bug#1575. Fixed the generation of PAL-N to match the description in Video
   Demystified.
8. Bug#1577. Changed the signal black/blank levels on component outputs to 
   match the descriptions in Video Demystified.
9. Changed plane buffer management so that buffers are released immediately
   after being removed from display in the case where the plane does not need
   a historic buffer for de-interlacing. This allows GDPs to use a two buffer
   double buffering scheme again in V4L2.
10. Bug#1596. GDP STBus transaction configuration on 7109Cut3.x
11. Change to support of single field queueing for video, new explicit
    buffer flags to specify top or bottom field only.
12. Bug#1783. Fixed HDMI initialization crash on <Cut3.0 7100, where HDMI isn't
    supported.

====================
stgfb-2.0_stm22_0005
====================

New Features
------------
1. Driver split into "core" and "framebuffer" modules, it is no longer necessary
   for a framebuffer to be active on a display pipeline before another driver
   can use it. See Linux/Documentation/stmcoredisplay.txt for more details on
   the core modules.
2. Extended screen parameters are now queried and set using new
   IOCTLs STMFBIO_GET_VAR_SCREENINFO_EX and STMFBIO_SET_VAR_SCREENINFO_EX,
   rather than individual IOCTLs.
3. Support for plane re-ordering.
4. Added support for RGB gain control on GDPs, allowing the brightness of
   graphics planes to be attenuated.
5. Added support for changing the alpha values used by the hardware when
   in ARGB1555 for the two alpha states (a=0 or a=1) on GDPs.
6. 7109 BDisp application queue is now supported for accelerated graphics as
   used by DirectFB.
7. 8bit CLUT framebuffer is now available on 7109C3.  

Changes/Fixes
-------------
1. Screen parameters such as global alpha are now all persistent across
   display mode changes.
2. The default framebuffer layer blend mode has been changed to assume RGB
   has been premultiplied by the alpha channel.
3. The IOCTLs STMFBIO_SET_TRANSPARENCY, STMFBIO_SET_COLOURKEY,
   STMFBIO_SET_PREMULTIPLIED_ALPHA & STMFBIO_SET_FLICKER_FILTER have
   been removed.
4. stfbcontrol now uses the VAR_SCREENINFO_EX IOCTLs.
5. New Linux module parameter setup for the framebuffer module, see
   Linux/Docmuentation/stmfb.txt for full details.
6. Remove Linux support for STm8000 and STi5528 as these chips are not
   supported on LDDE2.2


====================
stgfb-1.0_stm22_0004
====================

New Features
------------
1. Support 7109Cut3 GDP flicker filter. To get flicker filtering the image
   buffer must be marked as progressive when queued, the display output must
   be interlaced and the total lines in the source and destination viewports
   must be the same.
2. Support flicker filter setup in the Linux framebuffer and add test support
   into stfbcontrol.
3. Support for 7109 de-interlacer, although it is currently limited to median
   filtering until LMI VID allocation is available to allocate motion buffers
   for full temporal mode.

Changes/Fixes
-------------
1. Allow horizontal downscale to 1/2 size on 7109Cut3 GDPs.
2. Correct the support for single field interlaced buffer queuing.
3. Fix vertical cropping problem on 7109 main video plane.
4. Bug#1116 - fix blitter interrupt deregistration.


====================
stgfb-1.0_stm22_0003
====================

New Features
------------
1. Internal support for 7109Cut3 DVO features, 24bit RGB HD output (for extended
   package) and loopback of output to DVP.
2. Support NTSC-J as a default standard for the Linux framebuffer (tvstandard=J)

Changes/Fixes
-------------
1. Use new HDMI clocksetup on 7109Cut3 to allow the correct clock setup for
   the DVO in ED modes.
2. HDMI audio data flat bits are now set when the HDMI link is first started
   and when audio is not running and only cleared when valid audio is being
   generated. This should prevent invalid audio being presented by the TV;
   but it appears that not all TVs take any notice of the flat bits.
3. Bug#1054. Framebuffer crashes on exit on 7109.   
4. Bug#1056. HDMI audio source switch broken on 7109Cut3.


====================
stgfb-1.0_stm22_0002
====================

Changes/Fixes
-------------
1. Fix Bug#1010. Blitter rescaling filtering is disabled
2. Major internal interface rewrite. Kernel drivers wanting to use services
   from the core display driver now need to use the interfaces defined in
   stgfb/include/stmdisplay*.h . The previous Linux specific Devfb* interfaces
   no longer exist. OS21 based applications now need to be written to these
   new interfaces, rather than using the core driver C++ classes directly,
   as they are thread safe.
3. Changed how planes are locked for use; this is no longer done when the
   plane instance is got from the device. Instead a lock/unlock interface
   is provided to prevent multiple references to a plane queueing buffers.
   However other plane operations are available to all.
4. Fix Bug#1029. Bad video display on 7109 with certain horizontal
                 cropping parameters
5. Fix Bug#1036. A number of the FB IOCTLs are specified with the wrong macro
6. Fix Bug#1037. NTSC Line 20/283 VBI generation incorrect
7. Added support for all 625line and HDMI wide screen signalling modes. The
   V4L2 controls for TV aspect ratio, Video aspect ratio and letterbox mode
   (which is now an enumeration instead of a boolean) control the possibilities.
   On HDMI the TV aspect ratio control sets the "Picture Aspect Ratio" and
   sets the appropriate 4x3 or 16x9 CEA video code for the output display mode.
   The video aspect ratio and letterbox mode combine to set WSS/Active Format
   bits; undefined combinations result in a full screen display.


====================
stgfb-1.0_stm22_0001
====================

New Features
------------
1. Port to STLinux2.2 (Linux 2.6.17 and above), note that the driver is not
   backwards compatible with the STLinux2.0 2.6.11.12 kernels.
   
Changes/Fixes
-------------
1. Removed AVS initialisation from Linux framebuffer driver, if you want
   a real AV switch driver, write your own!
2. Changed kbuild support, all modules now build into a single directory
   Linux/kbuild.
3. Remove building of the kernel cfb.. software drawing modules. This can
   now be configured as part of the kernel graphics driver support in 2.6.17.
4. Major change to GDP (graphics plane) handling to support power management
   resume correctly in interlaced modes and faster display frame rates with
   DirectFB.
5. Change to linux framebuffer pan semantics, using the FB_ACTIVATE_VBL flag
   will cause the pan not to wait for the change to take effect - as long as
   there isn't more than one outstanding framebuffer change queued up. This
   allows DirectFB triple buffering to run at the real display refresh rate
   (as long as your drawing can keep up).
6. Remove unused triangle code from from the blitter driver and FB IOCTL
   interface.
