 *  The following allows HDMI data island packets of various types to be
 *  sent using the STMHDMIIO_SEND_DATA_PACKET interface. The possible types
 *  supported by this are:
 *
 *  - ACP data packets
 *  - Colour gamut data packets (Profile 0 only)
 *  - Vendor specific info frames
 *  - NTSC VBI info frames
 *
 *  If the timestamp field is {0,0} then the packet will be sent as soon as
 *  possible. Otherwise timestamp must be an absolute time in the
 *  timebase of CLOCK_MONOTONIC, i.e. offset from the time returned by
 *  clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC,...), so that the packet will not be sent
 *  until that time has passed. Packets of the same type are queued and
 *  processed in strict order, in the same way as V4L2 buffer queues. At most
 *  one packet is processed each VSync while the HDMI output is active.
 *
 *  Data packets may be queued when the HDMI output is disabled, in anticipation
 *  of it being restarted.
 *
 *  The data packet queues are NOT flushed for hotplug, display mode changes
 *  or explicit HDMI disable/enable sequences. While the HDMI output is disabled
 *  the queue will not be processed, possibly resulting in data eventually being
 *  presented late when the output is eventually re-started. A queue may be
 *  explicitly flushed using STMHDMIIO_FLUSH_DATA_PACKET_QUEUE to prevent this.
 *
 *
 *  ACP packets are only accepted for transmission if the connected TV's EDID
 *  has the supports_AI bit set. If the ACP type is set to 0 (Generic) then
 *  ACP packet transmission will be stopped. Otherwise the ACP packet data
 *  will be sent periodically to meet the HDMI specification of repeats at
 *  least every 300ms. The current ACP packet data is persistent across hotplug,
 *  display mode changes or explicit HDMI disable/enable sequences. Flushing
 *  the ACP data queue will also invalidate the current data.
 *
 *  Profile 0 colour gamut data packets are repeated once per video field until
 *  a new packet is set. The current color gamut packet data is persistent
 *  across hotplug, display mode changes or explicit HDMI disable/enable
 *  sequences. After setting an initial valid colour gamut data packet, to
 *  return to a standard colourspace a new data packet with the No_Crnt_GBD bit
 *  set (HB2 bit 7) should be sent. See the HDMI specification for details.
 *  Note however that flushing the color gamut data queue will also invalidate
 *  the color gamut data and stop the transmission of these packets.
 *
 *  Vendor and NTSC VBI info frames are sent once, based on the given timestamp.
 *
 *  The IOCTL can produce the following error conditions:
 *
 *  EINVAL     - the operation failed due to invalid data such as an unknown
 *               type or an attempt to queue with a timestamp in the past or
 *               earlier than the last packet still pending transmission with
 *               a non-zero timestamp.
 *  EPERM      - ACP data was being set and the connected TV does not indicate
 *               supports_AI in its EDID.
 *  EAGAIN     - the data packet system was temporarily unavailable, try again.
 *  EBUSY      - no more data packets of the given type can be queued yet.
 *  EOPNOTSUPP - the packet type is not supported on this implementation.

 *  The following configures HDMI ISRC data packets to be sent using the

 *
 *  If the timestamp field is {0,0} then the packet will be sent as soon as

 *  until that time has passed. Packets are queued and processed in strict
 *  order, in the same way as V4L2 buffer queues.
 *
 *  Once enabled, packets containing the provided data are sent continuously
 *  until replaced by new data or transmission is stopped. Setting the ISRC
 *  status to ISRC_STATUS_DISABLE will cause ISRC transmission to stop at the
 *  time indicated by the provided timestamp. The queued and current ISRC data
 *  is persistent across hotplug, display mode changes or explicit

 *  queue will not be processed, possibly resulting in data eventually being
 *  presented late when the output is re-started. The queue may be explicitly
 *  flushed using STMHDMIIO_FLUSH_DATA_PACKET_QUEUE, which will also invalidate
 *  the current data and stop the transmission of ISRC packets.

 *  EBUSY      - no more data packets can be queued (queue is full).

 * The driver supports three hotplug behaviours.
 *
 * (1) STMHDMIIO_HPD_ALWAYS_STOP_AND_RESTART - the default, a hotplug de-assert
 * will always cause the HDMI output to stop. The next hotplug assert will
 * attempt to restart the output (after reading the display's EDID) if it
 * has not been explicitly disabled. This mode is appropriate for a basic
 * STLinux system showing display demos based on standard Linux applications.
 *
 * (2) STMHDMIIO_HPD_DISABLE_OUTPUT - a hotplug de-assert will always cause the
 * HDMI output to stop and will additionally force the output into a "disabled"
 * state. The HDMI output must be explicitly re-enabled by the application
 * when it determines it is correct to do so. This is appropriate for a product
 * which wants to prevent any unsupported signals (video or audio) from reaching
 * the connected display; it allows the application to co-ordinate changes to
 * the rest of the system (such as video playback) before re-enabling the
 * output.
 *
 * (3) STMHDMIIO_HPD_STOP_IF_NECESSARY - a hotplug de-assert will not
 * immediately cause the HDMI output to stop. Instead the HDMI output will
 * continue until either a hotplug assert happens, or 1.5 seconds has
 * elapsed. If the time elapses the HDMI output will be stopped and disabled
 * as in (2). If hotplug is asserted again inside the time limit then the
 * display's new EDID is read and if the current display mode is no longer
 * supported the HDMI output is then stopped and disabled, otherwise the output
 * continues. Note that it is out of scope for the display driver to check any
 * changes to the audio capabilities of the system, the application needs to do
 * this and change the audio configuration if necessary. This is appropriate to
 * a media centre type product that wants to avoid disruption to audio only
 * playback when connected to an AVReceiver and HDMI repeater when a downstream
 * display device connected to the repeater is switched on/off.
